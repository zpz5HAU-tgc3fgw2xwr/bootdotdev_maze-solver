# 🧩 Maze Solver (Python)

This repository contains the **Maze Solver** project, developed as part of the [Boot.dev course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-maze-solver-python). The project focuses on creating an algorithmic solution to navigate and solve mazes using Python.

## 🚀 Features

- **Maze Navigation**: Automatically find paths from start to finish.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Solve mazes using BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search).
- **Visualization**: Print clear outputs of maze traversal and solutions.
- **Custom Mazes**: Create and test with your own maze inputs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Algorithm Design**: BFS and DFS implementations.
- **CLI Interface**: Run and test mazes directly from the terminal.
- **Unit Testing**: Verify algorithm accuracy with Python's `unittest` framework.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Implementing BFS and DFS in Python.
- Navigating two-dimensional arrays and graph-like structures.
- Building robust CLI tools for algorithm testing.
- Testing edge cases to ensure solver accuracy.

## 🧪 Testing

Unit tests ensure the correctness of maze traversal and algorithm performance. Tests cover:

- Validity of solved paths.
- Handling of unsolvable mazes.
- Performance on larger and complex mazes.

Run tests with:
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## 🌟 Why This Project?

The Maze Solver project provided hands-on experience with:

- Algorithm development and optimization.
- Applying graph traversal techniques in practical scenarios.
- Debugging and refining complex logic in Python.
